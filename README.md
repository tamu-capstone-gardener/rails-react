# PlantHub  

_This is a gardening assistant web appliation using Ruby on Rails, TailwindCSS, and StimulusJS. This web app works in conjunction with an ESP32 that acts as a hardware module to send signals for watering, lighting, etc. and sends sensor data such as soil moisture, temperature, etc. MQTT is used to facilitate this communication via a HiveMQ broker server._
